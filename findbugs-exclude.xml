        Transient field that isn't set by deserialization.
        This class contains a field that is updated at multiple places in the class, thus it seems to be part of the state of the class.
        However, since the field is marked as transient and not set in readObject or readResolve, it will contain the default value in any deserialized instance of the class.
        Bug kind and pattern: Se - SE_TRANSIENT_FIELD_NOT_RESTORED

        Method may fail to clean up stream or resource on checked exception
        This method may fail to clean up (close, dispose of) a stream, database object, or other resource requiring an explicit cleanup operation.
        In general, if a method opens a stream or other resource, the method should use a try/finally block to ensure that the stream or resource is cleaned up before the method returns.
        This bug pattern is essentially the same as the OS_OPEN_STREAM and ODR_OPEN_DATABASE_RESOURCE bug patterns, but is based on a different (and hopefully better) static analysis technique. We are interested is getting feedback about the usefulness of this bug pattern. To send feedback, either:
        send email to findbugs@cs.umd.edu
        file a bug report: http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/reportingBugs.html
        In particular, the false-positive suppression heuristics for this bug pattern have not been extensively tuned, so reports about false positives are helpful to us.
        See Weimer and Necula, Finding and Preventing Run-Time Error Handling Mistakes, for a description of the analysis technique.
