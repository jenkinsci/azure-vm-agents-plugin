    For Windows agents, if you want to use SSH then the image needs to be custom-prepared with an SSH server preinstalled.<br><br>

    When using connecting to the controller, ensure the following:<br>
    1)  Jenkins URL (Manage Jenkins --> System --> Jenkins Location) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This URL needs to be reachable by the agent, so make sure to configure the firewall rules accordingly. <br>
    2)  TCP port for JNLP agent agents (Manage Jenkins --> Security --> TCP port for inbound agents). <br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This port needs to be reachable from the agent. It is recommended to use a fixed port
        so that the necessary firewall exceptions can be specified. <br><br>
