User assigned managed identities enable Azure resources to authenticate to cloud services (e.g. Azure Key Vault) without storing credentials in code.
This type of managed identities are created as standalone Azure resources, and have their own lifecycle.
A single resource (e.g. Virtual Machine) can utilize multiple user assigned managed identities.
Similarly, a single user assigned managed identity can be shared across multiple resources (e.g. Virtual Machine).
