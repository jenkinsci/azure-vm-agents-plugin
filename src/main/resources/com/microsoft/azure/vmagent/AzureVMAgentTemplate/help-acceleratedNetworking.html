Accelerated Networking enables single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to a VM.
This results in improved networking performance, lower latency and less CPU utilization.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Note:</b>
<br/>
Accelerated Networking is not available for all VM sizes; if you enable this option for an unsupported VM size, deployment will <em>fail</em>.<br/>
Support for Accelerated Networking can be found in the individual virtual machine sizes documentation.
