    Minimum number of buffer machines to always have ready.
    <p>
    Regardless of the percentage calculation, at least this many idle machines
    will be maintained as buffer. This ensures a baseline level of readiness
    even when no jobs are running.
    </p>
    <p>
    Set to 0 to disable minimum buffer requirement.
