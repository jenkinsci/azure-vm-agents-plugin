<div>
    Maximum buffer size to prevent runaway scaling.
    <p>
    Limits how many buffer machines can be created, regardless of the percentage
    calculation. This helps control costs during sudden spikes in workload.
    </p>
    <p>
    Set to 0 or leave empty for no maximum limit (unlimited buffer scaling).
    </p>
    <p>Default: 0 (no limit)</p>
