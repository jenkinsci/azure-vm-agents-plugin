    Enable dynamic buffer sizing based on current workload.
    <p>
    When enabled, the plugin will automatically maintain additional idle machines
    (buffer) proportional to the number of busy machines and queued jobs.
    This ensures that new jobs always have machines ready immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
    The effective pool size becomes: <code>poolSize + calculatedBuffer</code>
