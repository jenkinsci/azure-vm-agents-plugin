<div>
    Percentage of busy machines to keep as buffer (0-100).
    <p>
    For example, if 10 machines are currently busy and buffer percentage is 20%,
    the plugin will try to maintain 2 additional idle machines as buffer.
    </p>
    <p>
    The buffer is also calculated based on queue length - whichever produces
    a larger buffer (busy machines % or queued jobs %) will be used.
    </p>
    <p>Default: 10%</p>
</div>
