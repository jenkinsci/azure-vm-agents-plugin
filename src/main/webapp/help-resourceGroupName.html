<div>
    Specify a resource group name.<br/>
    <b>Note</b><br/>
    Resource group name can only include alphanumeric characters, periods, underscores, hyphens and parenthesis and cannot end in a period.<br/><br/>
    Although it will also work when you type exist resource group name in "Create new", we recommend to use "Use existing" to avoid typo.
