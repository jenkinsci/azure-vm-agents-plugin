    An agent needs to have a directory dedicated to Jenkins. Specify the absolute path of this work directory on the agent,
    such as '/var/jenkins' or 'c:\jenkins'. This should be a path local to the agent machine.

    Typically, there's no need for this path to be visible from the master.</br></br>

    Agents do not maintain important data (other than active workspaces of projects last built on them), so you can possibly
    set the agent workspace to a temporary directory if it is ok to lose the latest workspace
    when the agent is turned off.
