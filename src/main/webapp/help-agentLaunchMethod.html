    Windows agents can be launched using SSH or JNLP. Linux agents can only be launched using SSH.<br>
    For Windows agents, if you want to use SSH then the image needs to be custom-prepared with an SSH server preinstalled.<br><br>

    When using JNLP launch, ensure following<br>
    1)  Jenkins URL (Manage Jenkins --> configure system --> Jenkins Location) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This URL needs to be reachable by the agent, so make sure to configure the firewall rules accordingly. <br>
    2)  TCP port for JNLP agent agents (Manage Jenkins --> configure global security --> Enable security --> TCP port for JNLP agents). <br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This port needs to be reachable from the agent launched using JNLP. It is recommended to use a fixed port
        so that the necessary firewall exceptions can be specified. <br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Jenkins master is running on Azure, then open an endpoint for "TCP port for JNLP agents"
        and add the necessary firewall rules (Run --> firewall.cpl) inside the virtual machine. <br>
