    Controls how Jenkins schedules builds on this node.<br/>
    <b>Use this node as much as possible</b><br/>
    This is the default setting.<br/>
    In this mode, Jenkins uses this node freely. Whenever there is a build that can be done by using this node, Jenkins will use it.<br/>
    <b>Only build jobs with label expressions matching this node</b><br/>
    In this mode, Jenkins will only build a project on this node when that project is restricted to certain nodes using a label expression, and that expression matches this node's name and/or labels.<br/>
    This allows a node to be reserved for certain kinds of jobs. For example, if you have jobs that run performance tests, you may want them to only run on a specially configured machine, while preventing all other jobs from using that machine. To do so, you would restrict where the test jobs may run by giving them a label expression matching that machine.<br/>
    Furthermore, if you set the # of executors value to 1, you can ensure that only one performance test will execute at any given time on that machine; no other builds will interfere.<br/>
